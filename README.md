## Description
This project is a simple app that allows users to enter money transactions, which are either adding funds or removing funds.  However, this app needs to work OFFLINE, and uses IndexedDB, as well as a manifest and service worker to display the app if it is down.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This project is used going to the site https://jdeleonardis-homework18-budget.herokuapp.com/.  To simulate the network being unavailable, you can use the chrome developer tools (F12), select Network, clicking the dropdown that says "Online", and select "Offline".  You should be able to continue to see the app on the web, as well as enter transactions.  You can then put the simulation of a down network into "Online" and data will be saved to a mongoDB collection
